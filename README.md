# DaME

The goal of `DaME` is to calculate a k-dimensional Dabrowska estimator. 

# Usage

Calculation of the k-dimensional Dabrowska estimator via `DaME` requires a data frame of k-dimensional survival data composed of survival times and censoring indicators. Users may use their own data, or simulate k-dimensional survival data using a built-in Clayton copula simulating process.
